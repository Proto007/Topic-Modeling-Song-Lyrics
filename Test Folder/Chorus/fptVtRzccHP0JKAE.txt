Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the fog wraps itself around you?
Do you want in to the outside in the sunshine
Where the clouds take their places for you?
Do you want in to the outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want in to the outside in the sunshine
Where the song repeats itself inside you?
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you
