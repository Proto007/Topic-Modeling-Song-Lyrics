Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
