If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me
If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me
If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me
