They call it climbing, and i call it visibility
They call it coolness, and i call it visibility
They call it way too rowdy, and i call it finally free
"I call it climbing, and you call it visibility
I call it coolness, and you call it visibility
I call it way too rowdy, and you call it finally free"
They call it climbing, and we call it visibility
They call it coolness, and we call it visibility
They call it way too rowdy, and we call it finally free
