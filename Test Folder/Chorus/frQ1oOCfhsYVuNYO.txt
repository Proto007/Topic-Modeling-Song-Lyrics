I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
Pour over me and wash my hands of it
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
Pour over me and wash my hands
Pour over me and wash my hands
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for what I can't change now
If I become what I cannot accept
Resurrect the saint within the wretch
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect, resurrect
Pour over me and wash my hands
Pour over me and wash my hands of it
