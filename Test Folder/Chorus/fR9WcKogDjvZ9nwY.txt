You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way
You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way
You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way
