You see the way the strobe lights are dancing, I look in your eyes and I
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
And baby, I'm not fore-taking chances, romance is in the air
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
I hope you're ready and when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air
Last night you're the one I was missing
But tonight you're standing right there
You see the way the strobe lights are dancing, I look in your eyes and I
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
And baby, I'm not fore-taking chances, romance is in the air
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
I hope you're ready and when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air
Last night you're the one I was missing
But tonight you're standing right there
You see the way the strobe lights are dancing, I look in your eyes and I
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
And baby, I'm not fore-taking chances, romance is in the air
Feel like falling in love tonight, falling in love tonight
I hope you're ready and when the moon gets high, let's start with some kissing
I heard the wind whisper your name in the air
Last night you're the one I was missing
But tonight you're standing right there
