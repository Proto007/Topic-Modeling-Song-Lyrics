When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends
You don't tell your family
I won't let them talk about me
I'm gonna let nobody down
When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends
You don't tell your family
I won't let them talk about me
I'm gonna let nobody down
When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends
You don't tell your family
I won't let them talk about me
I'm gonna let nobody down
When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends
You don't tell your family
I won't let them talk about me
I'm gonna let nobody down
When you're down and troubled
You don't tell your friends
You don't tell your family
I won't let them talk about me
I'm gonna let nobody down
