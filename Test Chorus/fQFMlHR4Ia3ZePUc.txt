Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me
It's never enough, I'm never complete
Tell me to prove, expect me to lose
I push it away, I'm trying to move
Hoping for more, and wishing for less
When I didn't care was when I did best
I'm desperate to run, I'm desperate to leave
If I lose it all, at least I'll be free
Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me
It's never enough, I'm never complete
Tell me to prove, expect me to lose
I push it away, I'm trying to move
Hoping for more, and wishing for less
When I didn't care was when I did best
I'm desperate to run, I'm desperate to leave
If I lose it all, at least I'll be free
Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me
It's never enough, I'm never complete
Tell me to prove, expect me to lose
I push it away, I'm trying to move
Hoping for more, and wishing for less
When I didn't care was when I did best
I'm desperate to run, I'm desperate to leave
If I lose it all, at least I'll be free
Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me
