But when we talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die, so that death can bring life again
And then we'll talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die, so that death can bring life again
Keep searching till we see it
And along the way, we'll trust each other
Let it lie, what is left is a light again
Then we can walk into forgiveness
It's the way we truly love each other
Let it die, so that death can bring life again
Hold it high, what is left is a light again
But when we talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die, so that death can bring life again
