I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around?
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be
