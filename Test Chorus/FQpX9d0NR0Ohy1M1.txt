And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
I'm alive, I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
I'm alive, I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
