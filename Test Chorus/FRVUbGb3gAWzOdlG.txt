Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion
Oh, my champion
Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion
Sometimes you fall before you rise
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again, oh
The world's gonna try and knock you out
Just pick yourself up when you go down
You've gotta keep fighting
And get back up again
My champion
