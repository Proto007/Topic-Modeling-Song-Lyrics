"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin
