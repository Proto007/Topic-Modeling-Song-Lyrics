What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love? (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared)
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
