Don't give up on me now 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb
Don't give up on me now 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb
Bleeding from my disconnection, lost inside myself
Forsaken by my own reflection, abandoning myself
Don't give up on me now 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb
Bleeding from my disconnection, lost inside myself
Forsaken by my own reflection, abandoning myself
