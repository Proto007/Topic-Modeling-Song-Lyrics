Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want your body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat, turn up the fire
Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want your body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat, turn up the fire
Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want your body next to my body now (want your body next to mine)
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now (so crazy good right now)
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat, turn up the fire
Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how (I can't believe, I can't believe boy)
Turn up the fire
I want your body next to my body now (ohhh)
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now (so crazy good, so crazy good boy)
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat, turn up the fire
Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how (I can't believe, I can't believe boy)
Turn up the fire
I want your body next to my body now (ohhh)
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now (so crazy good, so crazy good boy)
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat, turn up the fire
