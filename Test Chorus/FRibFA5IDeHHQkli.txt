My love, I would come through (Come through)
And fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same (Ooh)
You could love me the same (Ooh)
You could love me the same
And my love would be there
To fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same (Ooh)
You could love me the same (Ooh)
You could love me the same
