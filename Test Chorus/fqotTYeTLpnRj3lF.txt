If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?
If it's over, let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard?
You're so yesterday
