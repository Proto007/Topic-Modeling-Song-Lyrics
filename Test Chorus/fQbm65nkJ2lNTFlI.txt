One day when nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before,
You hit the walls and lost it all
I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to,
I'm never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
One day,
When nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before.
(You hit the wall and lost it all)
I'll find a way
To wake you from this bed you've made,
Even though I know you want me to.
I'm never giving up on you!
On you, on you.
I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!
On you, on you.
Never giving up, I'm never giving up
One day,
When nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before,
You hit the wall and lost it all.
I'll find a way
To wake you from this bed you've made,
Even though I know you want me to.
I'm never giving up on you!
On you, on you.
I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!
On you, on you.
Never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!
