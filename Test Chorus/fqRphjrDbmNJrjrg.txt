Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies
And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies
And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies
Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies
And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies
