Let me in the walls
You've built around
We can light a match
And burn them down
Let me hold your hand
And dance 'round and 'round the flames
In front of us
Dust to dust
Let me in the walls
You've built around
We can light a match
And burn them down
And let me hold your hand
And dance 'round and 'round the flames
In front of us
Dust to dust
