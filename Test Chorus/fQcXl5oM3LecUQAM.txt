Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side
Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side
I wanna feel alive
If I close my eyes, will it reverse the light?
Focus on one thing at a time
Please unwind, please unwind
I want to feel alive
