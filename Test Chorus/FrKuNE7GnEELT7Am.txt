Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
