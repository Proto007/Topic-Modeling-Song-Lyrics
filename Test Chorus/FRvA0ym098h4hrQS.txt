I'm gonna get me a motor car
Maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire
So can you take me there
Wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Growing older in the rain
I'm gonna get me a motor car
Maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire
So can you take me there
Wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Growing older in the rain
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Gettin' lost and lonely
Sad and only
Why sometimes
Does my life feel so tame?
