But you won't let me, you won't let me
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanna give it one more try
And I'd do anything, yes, I'd do anything
If you'd only let me
But you won't let me, you won't let me
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanna give it one more try
And I'd do anything, yes, I'd do anything
But you won't let me, you won't let me
I don't want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you won't let me, you won't let me
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you won't let me, you won't let me
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
But you won't let me, no, you won't let me
You won't let me
