You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
You take it all too seriously
You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from me
Here's all you get from me
You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from me
