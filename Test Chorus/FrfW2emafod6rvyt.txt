Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though
Ain't no givin' up, you already know how I give it up
Sippin' out the coffee cup, my Presidential face a hockey puck
Feed me dope, I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court (Yeah)
Skip to my lou (Skrrt), trappin' a sport (Skip to my lou)
Okay, fish butter, chicken cutter (Okay)
Maserati, we get mozzarella, yeah (Okay)
Go'n, you doin' that wrong (Out of here), Al Capone (Skrrt, skrrt)
Don't talk on phones 'cause we gettin' dope money all night long (Brrt)
